1.Neural Network with Keras

- Cross Validation Accuracy- 0.7422

2. Scikit Learn Test

- sklearn cross validation- 0.6601

- sklearn grid search parameters- 0.67317


I tried changing the batch size for the First neural network code and could 
conclude that a smaller batch size could also give fairly good results as the
neural network doesnt have complicated multi-layer architecture and the dataset is not extensive.
